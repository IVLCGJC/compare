To the extent that the Parties do not agree to delete or modify the provision, in whole or in part, under this clause 14.2, then such provision or part of it shall, to the extent that it is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, be deemed not to form part of this Agreement and the legality, validity and enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall, subject to any deletion or modification made under clause 14.2, not be affected.
14.3	No variation of this Agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of each of the Parties to it.
15.	Counterparts
	This Agreement may be entered into in any number of counterparts all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same instrument. A Party may enter into this Agreement by executing any such counterpart.
16.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Austria, excluding its conflict of law rules. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said Rules. Place of Arbitration shall be Vienna, Austria. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in the English language. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such arbitration tribunal and waives any objection to proceedings in any such forum on the ground of venue or on the ground that proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.
This section shall not prevent a Party from seeking an injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction.

Executed by the duly authorised representatives of the following Parties:
